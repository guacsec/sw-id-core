# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Per the Linux Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy, if you find a vulnerability in a project maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), please report that directly to the project maintaining that code, preferably using GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting.

Please report using the [main GUAC repisitory](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/security/advisories/new).

If you've been unable to find a way to report it, or have received no response after repeated attempts, please contact the OpenSSF security contact email, security@openssf.org.

Thank you.
